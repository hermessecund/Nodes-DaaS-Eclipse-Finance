# Nodes DaaS: Eclipse Finance

Eclipse Finance is a fictitious project. A high yield DaaS protocol on the Avalanche blockchain.

You will find on this repository the dApp developed in React and the associated smartcontract, developed in Solidity.

For those who don't know: Node projects in DeFi are investment platforms allowing 
users to buy a node with a token ($ECL here), node that will allow them to generate a passive income.
